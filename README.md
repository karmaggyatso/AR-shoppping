# AR-shoppping
To run the project in your device oyu need to install Unity and install the Vuforial librabry.
This is a protoype version of our project AR in shopping, any one can download and contribute in this project.

## Inspiration
In my past years, we had returned almost 75% of clothes because of difficulty in visualizing the clothes on us and most of the time cloth color that we thought will match our outfit didn't look appealing. Because of this problem, we're inspired to build this idea. 

## What it does
Right now our project detects the target and applies the 2d clothes image on the user body. However, the main idea is that the algorithm detects the body structure and generates the 3d clothes for the target body. 

## How I built it
We build this project using Unity and blender. In Unity, we used the vuforia library to use the AR (augmented reality) camera that allows us to use the camera of a device to detect the image target. Blender is used to produce a 3d image of clothes.

## Challenges I ran into 
We're new to Unity and blender, which was the primary challenge. Creating a 3d model in blender and implementing in our project was difficult. 

##Future Updates
When developing this project we found that for the 3D animation for the target body we need to make an algorithm using TensorFlow, which is a free AI tool by google, our team in working in that particular aspect and will relesae the final version very soon.
